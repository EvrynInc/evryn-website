# Evryn Website Design Spec

This document outlines design and copy changes to implement on evryn.ai. These decisions came from an extensive design session focused on making the site feel like *her* — warm, present, unhurried, intentional.

---

## Typography

**Font:** Karla (Google Fonts)
- Weight 300 (Light) for body text and logo
- Weight 400 for the tagline ("Evryn is your personal AI who finds you *your* people.")
- Logo letter-spacing: 0.12em

**Import:**
```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Karla:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;1,300;1,400&display=swap');
```

---

## Colors

- **Background:** #6DBAC4 (lagoon — unchanged)
- **Horizontal divider lines:** #C2593B (terracotta) — this is a new accent color
- **Text:** #FAF8F5 (existing warm cream/white — unchanged, just documenting for reference)

The terracotta is used *only* for the horizontal lines. It's a signature, not a highlighter.

---

## Paper Texture

Add a subtle paper texture overlay to the background. This gives the flat color a tactile, material feel — like good stationery.

```css
body::before {
  content: '';
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg viewBox='0 0 500 500' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cfilter id='n'%3E%3CfeTurbulence type='fractalNoise' baseFrequency='0.65' numOctaves='5' stitchTiles='stitch'/%3E%3C/filter%3E%3Crect width='100%25' height='100%25' filter='url(%23n)' fill='white'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");
  opacity: 0.14;
  pointer-events: none;
  mix-blend-mode: overlay;
  z-index: 1;
}
```

Make sure all content has `position: relative; z-index: 2;` (or higher) so it sits above the texture.

---

## Header Behavior

The header should be **fixed/sticky** with these properties:

1. **Background:** Same as page background (#6DBAC4) — so it's invisible at first
2. **Content scrolls behind it** — as user scrolls, text disappears beneath the header
3. **Logo has higher z-index than header** — the Seed of Life logo should scroll *over* the header (not behind it), then off the top of the screen. This creates a subtle effect: at first the header seems invisible, then you notice content disappearing behind it, but the logo got special treatment.
4. **Header elements pushed to edges** — logo on far left, "Join waitlist" on far right
5. **"Join waitlist" styled as a button** — match the styling of the waitlist form's submit button

---

## Hero Section Spacing

- **Tighten** the distance between the header and the Seed of Life logo
- **Tighten** the distance between the logo and "Imagine..."
- **Add more breathing room** above and below the "for *anything*" line — this is the pivot point
- **Increase line-height overall** — the hero text line spacing is currently too tight; open it up so each line has room to land

The hero is paced like poetry. Each line should feel deliberate, not cramped.

---

## Pillar Sections

The pillar sections ("You just talk to Evryn", "She finds *your* people", "She guards your gates", "Our promise") should:

- **Expand to fill the full width of the page** — edge to edge, wall to wall
- No matter how the browser is resized, pillars should stretch to fill available width
- **Preserve existing responsive behavior** — pillars currently switch from side-by-side to stacked at a certain breakpoint; keep that breakpoint and stacking behavior intact

---

## Copy Changes

### Pillar 1: "You just talk to Evryn"
**Current:** "She listens, learns what you actually need, and continues to deepen her understanding of you."

**New:** "She listens, gets to know you, and discovers what you actually need. No searching. No swiping. No profiles to build."

### Pillar 2: "She finds *your* people"
**Current first line:** "Whoever you need: soulmate, cofounder, crew, someone fun..."

**New first line:** "Just the right fit: soulmate, cofounder, crew, someone fun..."

### Pillar 3: "She guards your gates"
**Current:** "No public profile and no open messaging means there's simply no way for pesterers, creeps, spammers, or scammers to even find you."

**New:** "No public profile and no open messaging means there's simply no way for pesterers, creeps, spammers, or scammers to even know you exist."

## Design Philosophy (for context)

Evryn isn't a tech product. She's a presence — a gatekeeper who knows you and guards your gates. The site should feel like a *place*, not a landing page. Warm, still, unhurried. The restraint is intentional: one font, one accent color (used sparingly), subtle texture. Everything says "someone's home."
