# Evryn Website — SEO & Google Indexing Fixes

## Context

Google Search Console is reporting two indexing issues:
1. **"Alternate page with proper canonical tag"** — benign, means canonical tags are working correctly on duplicate URL variants
2. **"Page with redirect"** — Google is finding URLs that redirect (likely http→https, www→non-www, or trailing slash variants); if sitemap references these, it's a problem

Additionally:
- Google's search snippet for evryn.ai shows **stale content from ~1 month ago** — needs re-crawl
- Searching **"Evryn AI"** triggers Google's "did you mean Everlyn AI" autocorrect, pushing us below Everlyn (a video AI company) — we need stronger brand signal
- We were briefly #1 for "Evryn AI" after manually requesting indexing in Google Search Console, but have since dropped

## Fixes to Implement

### 1. Meta Tags — Homepage (`<head>`)

The current page title is "Evryn - Find your people" which is decent but needs more SEO weight. Update/ensure these meta tags exist:

```html
<title>Evryn AI | Your Personal AI Who Finds You Your People</title>
<meta name="description" content="Evryn is a personal AI who finds you the right people for anything — soulmate, cofounder, crew, someone fun. She only connects people she trusts." />

<!-- Open Graph -->
<meta property="og:title" content="Evryn AI | Your Personal AI Who Finds You Your People" />
<meta property="og:description" content="Evryn is a personal AI who finds you the right people for anything — soulmate, cofounder, crew, someone fun. She only connects people she trusts." />
<meta property="og:url" content="https://www.evryn.ai/" />
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Evryn AI" />
<meta property="og:type" content="website" />
<!-- Add og:image if you have a social share image -->

<!-- Twitter/X -->
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta name="twitter:title" content="Evryn AI | Your Personal AI Who Finds You Your People" />
<meta name="twitter:description" content="Evryn is a personal AI who finds you the right people for anything. She only connects people she trusts." />

<!-- Canonical — critical: pick ONE canonical URL and stick with it -->
<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.evryn.ai/" />
```

**Important:** The word "AI" should appear prominently in the title. This helps Google associate "Evryn" + "AI" as a real brand, reducing the autocorrect to "Everlyn."

### 2. Structured Data — Organization Schema

Add JSON-LD structured data to the homepage. This explicitly tells Google "Evryn is a company" and reinforces the brand name:

```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "Evryn",
  "alternateName": "Evryn AI",
  "url": "https://www.evryn.ai",
  "description": "Evryn is a personal AI who finds you the right people for anything in life. She only connects people she trusts.",
  "foundingDate": "2024",
  "founder": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Justin McGowan"
  },
  "contactPoint": {
    "@type": "ContactPoint",
    "email": "contact@evryn.ai",
    "contactType": "customer service"
  },
  "sameAs": []
}
</script>
```

As you add social profiles (LinkedIn company page, X/Twitter, etc.), add their URLs to the `sameAs` array. This builds the web of brand signals Google uses.

### 3. Sitemap — Check and Fix

Check if `sitemap.xml` exists at the root. If it does, make sure:
- It only lists canonical URLs (e.g., `https://www.evryn.ai/`, `https://www.evryn.ai/privacy-policy`)
- It does NOT list `http://` variants, non-www variants if www is canonical, or trailing-slash variants that redirect
- It includes a `<lastmod>` date that reflects the most recent content change

If no sitemap exists, create one:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.evryn.ai/</loc>
    <lastmod>2026-02-13</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://www.evryn.ai/privacy-policy</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-12-01</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.3</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

Update `<lastmod>` dates to reflect actual last-modified dates.

### 4. robots.txt — Check and Fix

Ensure `robots.txt` at the root allows crawling and points to the sitemap:

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://www.evryn.ai/sitemap.xml
```

### 5. Redirect Consistency

The "Page with redirect" errors in Search Console are likely caused by inconsistent URL handling. Check your Next.js config (or Vercel settings) to ensure:

- **One canonical domain:** Decide if it's `www.evryn.ai` or `evryn.ai` — all variants must 301 redirect to the chosen one
- **HTTPS enforced:** All `http://` requests 301 to `https://`
- **Trailing slash consistency:** Pick one pattern and redirect the other

In `next.config.js` (or equivalent):
```js
// Example: if www is canonical
module.exports = {
  async redirects() {
    return [
      // Add any needed redirects here
    ]
  },
  // Trailing slash preference
  trailingSlash: false, // or true — just be consistent
}
```

On Vercel, you can also configure redirects in `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "has": [{ "type": "host", "value": "evryn.ai" }],
      "destination": "https://www.evryn.ai/$1",
      "permanent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### 6. Copyright Year

The footer currently says `© 2025 Evryn, Inc.` — update to `© 2025–2026 Evryn, Inc.` or just `© 2026 Evryn, Inc.`

## After Deploying These Changes

Once the code changes are deployed, Justin needs to manually do these steps in Google Search Console (https://search.google.com/search-console):

1. **Submit updated sitemap:** Go to Sitemaps → enter `sitemap.xml` → Submit
2. **Request re-indexing of homepage:** Go to URL Inspection → enter `https://www.evryn.ai/` → click "Request Indexing"
3. **Check the redirect errors:** Go to Pages → click on "Page with redirect" to see which specific URLs are affected, and verify the fixes resolved them
4. **Check canonical errors:** Go to Pages → click "Alternate page with proper canonical tag" to verify these are only expected duplicates (www vs non-www, etc.)

Google typically re-crawls within a few days of requesting indexing, but the search snippet may take 1-2 weeks to fully update.

## Longer-Term Brand Signal (Not Code — Just Awareness)

To stop Google autocorrecting "Evryn AI" to "Everlyn AI":
- Create a LinkedIn company page for Evryn and link to evryn.ai
- If/when you have a Twitter/X account, keep "Evryn AI" in the display name
- Consider a Crunchbase listing (free) — strong signal for company names
- Any press mentions or backlinks from other sites mentioning "Evryn" help enormously
- A Google Business Profile (even without a physical storefront — you can list as service-area business) is one of the strongest brand signals
